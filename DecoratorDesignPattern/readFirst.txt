The Decorator Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.
It involves creating a set of decorator classes that are used to wrap concrete components.

Characteristics of the Decorator Pattern

This pattern promotes flexibility and extensibility in software systems by allowing developers to compose objects with different combinations of functionalities at runtime.
It follows the open/closed principle, as new decorators can be added without modifying existing code, making it a powerful tool for building modular and customizable software components.
The Decorator Pattern is commonly used in scenarios where a variety of optional features or behaviors need to be added to objects in a flexible and reusable manner, such as in text formatting, graphical user interfaces, or customization of products like coffee or ice cream.
