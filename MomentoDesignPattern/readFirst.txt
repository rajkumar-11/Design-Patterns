The Memento design pattern is a behavioral pattern that is used to capture and restore an object’s internal state without violating encapsulation. It allows you to save and restore the state of an object to a previous state, providing the ability to undo or roll back changes made to the object.

    As your application progresses, you may want to save checkpoints in your application and restore them to those checkpoints later.
    The intent of the Memento Design pattern is without violating encapsulation, to capture and externalize an object’s internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later.
