The Observer Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object (the subject) changes state, all its dependents (observers) are notified and updated automatically.

It primarily deals with the interaction and communication between objects, specifically focusing on how objects behave in response to changes in the state of other objects.
